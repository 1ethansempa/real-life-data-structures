# Linked List

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the list. It is called a "linked" list because each element holds a reference (or link) to the next element.

## Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the list. It forms a unidirectional sequence where traversal is only possible in one direction, typically from the head (the first node) to the tail (the last node)

[Node] -> [Node] -> [Node] -> null

## Doubly Linked List

In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes in the list. This bidirectional linkage allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

null <- [Node] <-> [Node] <-> [Node] -> null
